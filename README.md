# Lemon

# What is Lemon?
Lemon is a program built on Google Apps Script to automatically organize Chelmsford's 24 Hour Relay Teams' information into a readable format on a Google Spreadsheet (called Master List), as opposed to past practice of hours of manual organization by hand

# Why is it called Lemon?
The Organization that runs the Chelmsford 24 Hour Relay is called LIME (Leadership in Motion Everywhere), thus it was only fitting to call this program Lemon
