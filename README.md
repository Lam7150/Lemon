# Lemon

<h3> What is Lemon? </h3>
Lemon is a program built on Google Apps Script to automatically organize Chelmsford's 24 Hour Relay Teams' information into a readable format on a Google Spreadsheet (called Master List), as opposed to past practice of hours of manual organization by hand

<h3> Why is it called Lemon? </h3>
The organization that runs the Chelmsford 24 Hour Relay is called LIME (Leadership in Motion Everywhere), so why not call it Lemon?

<h3> How does it work? </h3>
1. People sign up on Jotform

2. Jotform sends the formsâ€™ information into a Google spreadsheet

3. The spreadsheet information is then organized onto the formatted Master List through Lemon
